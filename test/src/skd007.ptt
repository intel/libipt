; SKD007: Intel(R) PT Buffer Overflow May Result in Incorrect Packets.
;
;         Under complex micro-architectural conditions, an Intel PT (Processor
;         Trace) OVF (Overflow) packet may be issued after the first byte of a
;         multi-byte CYC (Cycle Count) packet, instead of any remaining bytes
;         of the CYC.
