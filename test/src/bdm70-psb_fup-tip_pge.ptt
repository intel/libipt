; BDM70: Intel(R) Processor Trace PSB+ Packets May Contain Unexpected Packets.
;
;        Some Intel Processor Trace packets should be issued only between
;        TIP.PGE and TIP.PGD packets.  Due to this erratum, when a TIP.PGE
;        packet is generated it may be preceded by a PSB+ that incorrectly
;        includes FUP and MODE.Exec packets.

; Variant: sync at the PSB directly preceding the TIP.PGE.

;          Tracing is already enabled after the sync and the explicit
;          enable event is suppressed as duplicate.
