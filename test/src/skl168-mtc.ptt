; SKL168: Intel(R) PT CYC Packets Can be Dropped When Immediately Preceding PSB
;
;         Due to a rare microarchitectural condition, generation of an Intel PT
;         (Processor Trace) PSB (Packet Stream Boundary) packet can cause a
;         single CYC (Cycle Count) packet, possibly along with an associated
;         MTC (Mini Time Counter) packet, to be dropped.
;
; Variant: MTC and corresponding CYC packet dropped
