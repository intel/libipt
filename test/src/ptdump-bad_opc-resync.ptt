; Test that ptdump resyncs at the next PSB after a decode error.
;
; We try to synchronize at PSB that have been partially consumed by the
; previous packet.  Make sure we do not resync at the current PSB if the
; error occurred right after it.
;
; We pad the trace stream to place the error at a 64b boundary to account
; for the aligning we do in our PSB pattern search.
