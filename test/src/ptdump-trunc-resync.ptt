; Test that ptdump resyncs at a PSB that truncated a preceding packet.
;
; We already align the read pointer to use aligned 64b reads, so we get this
; right sometime, already.  This test covers the case where we didn't.
;
; We pad the trace stream to place the error 1B into a 64b boundary.  When
; we align the read pointer, this will skip the remainder of this 64b word.
;
; The MNT consumed the first 64b of the PSB.  So we start our PSB search at
; the last byte of it.
