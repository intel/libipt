; SKZ84: Use of VMX TSC Scaling or TSC Offsetting Will Result in
;        Corrupted Intel PT Packets
;
;        When Intel(R) PT (Processor Trace) is enabled within a VMX (Virtual
;        Machine Extensions) guest, and TSC (Time Stamp Counter) offsetting or
;        TSC scaling is enabled for that guest, by setting primary
;        processor-based execution control bit 3 or secondary processor-based
;        execution control bit 25, respectively, in the VMCS (Virtual Machine
;        Control Structure) for that guest, any TMA (TSC(MTC Alignment) packet
;        generated will have corrupted values in the CTC (Core Timer Copy) and
;        FastCounter fields.  Additionally, the corrupted TMA packet will be
;        followed by a bogus data byte.
