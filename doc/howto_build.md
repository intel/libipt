This chapter gives step-by-step instructions for building the library and the
sample tools using cmake.  For detailed information on cmake, see
http://www.cmake.org.


## Configuration

Besides the standard cmake options of build type and install directory, you will
find project-specific options for enabling optional features, optional
components, or optional build variants.


### Optional Components

By default, only the decoder library is built.  Other components can be enabled
by setting the respective cmake variable to ON.

The following optional components are available:

    PTUNIT             A simple unit test framework.
                       A collection of unit tests for libipt.

    PTDUMP             A packet dumper example.

    PTXED              A trace disassembler example.

    PTTC               A trace test generator.

    SIDEBAND           A sideband correlation library

    PEVENT             Support for the Linux perf_event sideband format.

                       This feature requires the linux/perf_event.h header.


### Optional Features

Features are enabled by setting the respective FEATURE_<name> cmake variable.
This causes the FEATURE_<name> pre-processor macro to be defined and may also
cause additional source files to be compiled and additional libraries to be
linked.

Features are enabled globally and will be used by all components that support
the feature.  The following features are supported:

    FEATURE_ELF         Support for the ELF object format.

                        This feature requires the elf.h header.


    FEATURE_THREADS     Support some amount of multi-threading.

                        This feature makes image functions thread-safe.


### Build Variants

Some build variants depend on libraries or header files that may not be
available on all supported platforms.

    GCOV                Support for code coverage using libgcov.

                        This build variant requires libgcov and is not 
                        available on Windows.


    DEVBUILD            Enable compiler warnings and turn them into errors.


### Version Settings

The major, minor, and patch version numbers are set in the sources and
must be changed there.  You can set the optional build number and an
arbitrary extension string.

    PT_VERSION_BUILD    The optional build number.

                        Defaults to zero (no build number).


    PT_VERSION_EXT      An arbitrary version extension string.

                        Defaults to the empty string (no extension string).


### Dependencies

In order to build ptxed, the location of the XED library and the XED header
files must be specified.

    XED_INCLUDE         Path to the directory containing the XED header files.

    XED_LIBDIR          Path to the directory containing the XED library.


When using XED from a PIN distribution, the respective directories are located
in `extras/xed2-<arch>/`.

When using XED from github, the respective directories are located in the
install directory (default: kits/xed-install-date-os-cpu) and the header
files are located in include/xed.  Please refer to the README in the XED
tree on how to build XED.


## Building on Linux``*`` and OS X``*``

We recommend out-of-tree builds.  Start by creating the destination directory
and navigating into it:

    $ mkdir -p /path/to/dest
    $ cd /path/to/dest


From here, call cmake with the top-level source directory as argument.  You may
already pass some or all of the cmake variables as arguments to cmake.  Without
arguments, cmake uses default values.

    $ cmake /path/to/src


If you have not passed values for XED_INCLUDE or XED_LIBDIR, you need to
configure them now if you want to build ptxed.  You may also use this command to
change the configuration at any time later on.

    $ make edit_cache


After configuring the cmake cache, you can build either specific targets or
everything using one of:

    $ make <target>
    $ make


Use the help make target to learn about available make targets:

    $ make help



## Building on Windows``*``

We recommend using the cmake GUI.  After starting the cmake GUI, fill in the
following fields:

    Where is the source code:       Path to the top-level source directory.

    Where to build the binaries:    Path to the destination directory.


We recommend out-of-tree builds, so the build directory should not be the same
as or below the source directory.  After this first configuration step, press
the

    Configure

button and select the builder you want to use.

Cmake will now populate the remainder of the window with configuration options.
Please make sure to specify at least XED_INCLUDE and XED_LIBDIR if you want to
build ptxed.  After completing the configuration, press the

    Generate

button.  If you selected a Visual Studio generator in the first step, cmake will
now generate a Visual Studio solution.  You can repeat this step if you want to
change the configuration later on.  Beware that you always need to press the
Generate button after changing the configuration.

In the case of a Visual Studio generator, you may now open the generated Visual
Studio solution and build the library and samples.
