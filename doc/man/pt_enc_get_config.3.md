# DESCRIPTION

These functions return a pointer to their argument's configuration.  The
returned configuration object must not be freed.  It is valid as long as their
argument is not freed.


# RETURN VALUE

These functions returns a pointer to a *pt_config* object.  The returned pointer
is NULL if their argument is NULL.
