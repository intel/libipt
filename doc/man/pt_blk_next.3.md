# DESCRIPTION

**pt_blk_next**() provides the next block of instructions in execution order,
which is described by the *pt_block* structure.

The *size* argument must be set to *sizeof(struct pt_block)*.  The function will
provide at most *size* bytes of the *pt_block* structure.  A newer decoder
library may truncate an extended *pt_block* object to *size* bytes.

An older decoder library may provide less *pt_block* fields.  Fields that are
not provided will be zero-initialized.  For fields where zero is a valid value
(e.g. for bit-fields), check the decoder library version to determine which
fields are valid.  See **pt_library_version**(3).

On success, the next block of instructions is provided in the *pt_block* object
pointed to by the *block* argument.  The *pt_block* structure is declared as:

~~~{.c}
/** A block of instructions.
 *
 * Instructions in this block are executed sequentially but are not necessarily
 * contiguous in memory.  Users are expected to follow direct branches.
 */
struct pt_block {
    /** The IP of the first instruction in this block. */
    uint64_t ip;

    /** The IP of the last instruction in this block.
     *
     * This can be used for error-detection.
     */
    uint64_t end_ip;

    /** The image section that contains the instructions in this block.
     *
     * A value of zero means that the section did not have an identifier.
     * The section was not added via an image section cache or the memory
     * was read via the read memory callback.
     */
    int isid;

    /** The execution mode for all instructions in this block. */
    enum pt_exec_mode mode;

    /** The instruction class for the last instruction in this block.
     *
     * This field may be set to ptic_error to indicate that the instruction
     * class is not available.  The block decoder may choose to not provide
     * the instruction class in some cases for performance reasons.
     */
    enum pt_insn_class iclass;

    /** The number of instructions in this block. */
    uint16_t ninsn;

    /** The raw bytes of the last instruction in this block in case the
     * instruction does not fit entirely into this block's section.
     *
     * This field is only valid if \@truncated is set.
     */
    uint8_t raw[pt_max_insn_size];

    /** The size of the last instruction in this block in bytes.
     *
     * This field is only valid if \@truncated is set.
     */
    uint8_t size;

    /** A collection of flags giving additional information about the
     * instructions in this block.
     *
     * - all instructions in this block were executed speculatively.
     */
    uint32_t speculative:1;

    /** - speculative execution was aborted after this block. */
    uint32_t aborted:1;

    /** - speculative execution was committed after this block. */
    uint32_t committed:1;

    /** - tracing was disabled after this block. */
    uint32_t disabled:1;

    /** - tracing was enabled at this block. */
    uint32_t enabled:1;

    /** - tracing was resumed at this block.
     *
     *    In addition to tracing being enabled, it continues from the IP
     *    at which tracing had been disabled before.
     *
     *    If tracing was disabled at a call instruction, we assume that
     *    tracing will be re-enabled after returning from the call at the
     *    instruction following the call instruction.
     */
    uint32_t resumed:1;

    /** - normal execution flow was interrupted after this block. */
    uint32_t interrupted:1;

    /** - tracing resumed at this block after an overflow. */
    uint32_t resynced:1;

    /** - tracing was stopped after this block. */
    uint32_t stopped:1;

    /** - the last instruction in this block is truncated.
     *
     *    It starts in this block's section but continues in one or more
     *    other sections depending on how fragmented the memory image is.
     *
     *    The raw bytes for the last instruction are provided in \@raw and
     *    its size in \@size in this case.
     */
    uint32_t truncated:1;
};
~~~

The fields of the *pt_block* structure are described in more detail below:

ip
:   The virtual address of the first instruction in the block.  The address
    should be interpreted in the current address space context.

end_ip
:   The virtual address of the last instruction in the block.  The address
    should be interpreted in the current address space context.

    This can be used for error detection.  Reconstruction of the instructions in
    a block should end with the last instruction at *end_ip*.

isid
:   The image section identifier of the section from which the block of
    instructions originated.  This will be zero unless the instructions came
    from a section that was added via an image section cache.  See
    **pt_image_add_cached**(3).

    The image section identifier can be used for reading the memory containing
    an instruction in order to decode it and for tracing an instruction back to
    its binary file and from there to source code.

mode
:   The execution mode at which the instructions in the block were executed.
    The *pt_exec_mode* enumeration is declared as:

~~~{.c}
/** An execution mode. */
enum pt_exec_mode {
    ptem_unknown,
    ptem_16bit,
    ptem_32bit,
    ptem_64bit
};
~~~

iclass
:   A coarse classification of the last instruction in the block.  This may be
    *ptic_error* to indicate that the classification is not available.

    The block decoder knows the instruction class of the instruction that ended
    the block most of the time.  If it does, it provides this information to
    save the caller the effort of decoding the instruction in some cases.

ninsn
:   The number of instructions contained in this block.

    The instructions are sequential in the sense that no trace is required for
    reconstructing them.  They are not necessarily contiguous in memory.

    The IP of the first instruction is given in the *ip* field and the IP of
    other instructions can be determined by decoding and examining the previous
    instruction.

raw
:   If the last instruction of this block can not be read entirely from this
    block's section, this field provides the instruction's raw bytes.

    It is only valid if the *truncated* flag is set.

size
:   If the last instruction of this block can not be read entirely from this
    block's section, this field provides the instruction's size in bytes.

    It is only valid if the *truncated* flag is set.

speculative
:   A flag giving the speculative execution status of all instructions in the
    block.  If set, the instructions were executed speculatively.  Otherwise,
    the instructions were executed normally.

aborted
:   A flag saying whether speculative execution was aborted after the last
    instruction in this block.  If set, speculative execution was aborted and
    the effect of speculatively executed instructions prior to and including
    this block was discarded.

committed
:   A flag saying whether the speculative execution state was committed after
    the last instruction in this block.  If set, the effect of speculatively
    executed instructions prior to and including this block was committed.

disabled
:   A flag saying that tracing was disabled after the last instruction in this
    block.  If set, tracing was disabled after the last instruction in this
    block retired.

enabled
:   A flag saying whether tracing was enabled at the first instruction in this
    block.  If set, this is the first block of instructions after tracing was
    enabled.

resumed
:   A flag saying whether tracing was resumed at the first instruction in this
    block.  If set, tracing was previously disabled at this block's IP before
    executing the instruction at that IP and was then enabled at the same IP.

    A typical example would be a system call or interrupt when tracing only user
    space.  Tracing is disabled due to the context switch and is then resumed
    from the next instruction after returning to user space.

interrupted
:   A flag saying whether normal execution flow was interrupted after the last
    instruction in this block.  If set, the normal execution flow was
    interrupted.

    The next instruction, which is provided by another call to
    **pt_blk_next**(), is the next instruction that retired after the
    interrupt.  This is not necessarily the interrupt's destination.

resynced
:   A flag saying whether tracing resumed at the fist instruction in this block
    after an overflow.  If set, there was an internal buffer overflow and
    packets were lost.  This was the first block of instructions to retire after
    the overflow resolved.

stopped
:   A flag saying whether tracing was stopped after the last instruction in this
    block.  If set, this is the last block of instructions that retired before
    tracing was stopped due to a TraceStop condition.

truncated
:   A flag saying whether the last instruction in this block can not be read
    entirely from this block's section.  Some bytes need to be read from one or
    more other sections.  This can happen when an image section is partially
    overwritten by another image section.

    If set, the last instruction's memory is provided in *raw* and its size in
    *size*.


# RETURN VALUE

**pt_blk_next**() returns zero or a positive value on success or a negative
*pt_error_code* enumeration constant in case of an error.

On success, a bit-vector of *pt_status_flag* enumeration constants is returned.
The *pt_status_flag* enumeration is declared as:

~~~{.c}
/** Decoder status flags. */
enum pt_status_flag {
    /** There is an event pending. */
    pts_event_pending    = 1 << 0,

    /** The address has been suppressed. */
    pts_ip_suppressed    = 1 << 1,

    /** There is no more trace data available. */
    pts_eos              = 1 << 2
};
~~~

The *pt_eos* flag indicates that the information contained in the Intel PT
stream has been consumed.  Further calls to **pt_blk_next**() will continue to
provide blocks for instructions as long as the instruction's addresses can be
determined without further trace.


# ERRORS

pte_invalid
:   The *decoder* or *block* argument is NULL or the *size* argument is too
    small.

pte_eos
:   Decode reached the end of the trace stream.

pte_nosync
:   The decoder has not been synchronized onto the trace stream.  Use
    **pt_blk_sync_forward**(3), **pt_blk_sync_backward**(3), or
    **pt_blk_sync_set**(3) to synchronize *decoder*.

pte_bad_opc
:   The decoder encountered an unsupported Intel PT packet opcode.

pte_bad_packet
:   The decoder encountered an unsupported Intel PT packet payload.

pte_bad_query
:   Execution flow reconstruction and trace got out of sync.

    This typically means that, on its way to the virtual address of the next
    event, the decoder encountered a conditional or indirect branch for which it
    did not find guidance in the trace.
