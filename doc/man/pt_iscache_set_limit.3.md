# NAME

pt_iscache_set_limit - set the mapped image section cache limit


# SYNOPSIS

| **\#include `<intel-pt.h>`**
|
| **int pt_iscache_set_limit(struct pt_image_section_cache \**iscache*,**
|                          **uint64_t *limit*);**

Link with *-lipt*.


# DESCRIPTION

**pt_iscache_set_limit**() sets the mapped image section cache limit.  The
*iscache* argument points to the *pt_image_section_cache* object.  The *limit*
argument gives the limit in bytes.

The image section cache will spend at most *limit* bytes to keep image sections
mapped as opposed to mapping and unmapping them when reading from them.  This
includes the memory for any caches associated with the mapped section.

A *limit* of zero disables caching and clears the cache.


# RETURN VALUE

**pt_iscache_set_limit**() returns zero on success or a negative *pt_error_code*
enumeration constant in case of an error.


# ERRORS

pte_invalid
:   The *iscache* argument is NULL.
