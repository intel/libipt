# NAME

pt_pkt_sync_forward, pt_pkt_sync_backward, pt_pkt_sync_set - synchronize an
Intel(R) Processor Trace packet decoder


# SYNOPSIS

| **\#include `<intel-pt.h>`**
|
| **int pt_pkt_sync_forward(struct pt_packet_decoder \**decoder*);**
| **int pt_pkt_sync_backward(struct pt_packet_decoder \**decoder*);**
| **int pt_pkt_sync_set(struct pt_packet_decoder \**decoder*,**
|                     **uint64_t *offset*);**

Link with *-lipt*.


# DESCRIPTION

**pt_pkt_sync_forward**() and **pt_pkt_sync_backward**() synchronize an Intel
Processor Trace (Intel PT) packet decoder pointed to by *decoder* onto the trace
stream in *decoder*'s trace buffer.  They search for a Packet Stream Boundary
(PSB) packet in the trace stream and, if successful, set *decoder*'s current
position to that packet.

**pt_pkt_sync_forward**() searches in forward direction from *decoder*'s current
position towards the end of the trace buffer.  If *decoder* has been newly
allocated and has not been synchronized yet, the search starts from the
beginning of the trace.

**pt_pkt_sync_backward**() searches in backward direction from *decoder*'s
current position towards the beginning of the trace buffer.  If *decoder* has
been newly allocated and has not been synchronized yet, the search starts from
the end of the trace.

**pt_pkt_sync_set**() sets *decoder*'s current position to *offset* bytes from
the beginning of its trace buffer.


# RETURN VALUE

All synchronization functions return zero or a positive value on success or a
negative *pt_error_code* enumeration constant in case of an error.


# ERRORS

pte_invalid
:   The *decoder* argument is NULL.

pte_eos
:   There is no (further) PSB packet in the trace stream
    (**pt_pkt_sync_forward**() and **pt_pkt_sync_backward**()) or the *offset*
    argument is too big and the resulting position would be outside of
    *decoder*'s trace buffer (**pt_pkt_sync_set**()).


# EXAMPLE

The following example re-synchronizes an Intel PT packet decoder after decode
errors:

~~~{.c}
int foo(struct pt_packet_decoder *decoder) {
	for (;;) {
		int errcode;

		errcode = pt_pkt_sync_forward(decoder);
		if (errcode < 0)
			return errcode;

		do {
			errcode = decode(decoder);
		} while (errcode >= 0);
	}
}
~~~
