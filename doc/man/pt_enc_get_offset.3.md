# NAME

pt_enc_get_offset, pt_enc_sync_set - get/set an Intel(R) Processor Trace packet
encoder's current trace buffer offset


# SYNOPSIS

| **\#include `<intel-pt.h>`**
|
| **int pt_enc_get_offset(const struct pt_packet_encoder \**encoder*,**
|                       **uint64_t \**offset*);**
| **int pt_enc_sync_set(const struct pt_packet_encoder \**encoder*,**
|                     **uint64_t *offset*);**

Link with *-lipt*.


# DESCRIPTION

**pt_enc_get_offset**() provides *encoder*'s current position as offset in bytes
from the beginning of *encoder*'s trace buffer in the unsigned integer variable
pointed to by *offset*.

**pt_enc_sync_set**() sets *encoder*'s current position to *offset* bytes from
the beginning of its trace buffer.


# RETURN VALUE

Both functions return zero on success or a negative *pt_error_code* enumeration
constant in case of an error.


# ERRORS

pte_invalid
:   The *encoder* or *offset* (for **pt_enc_sync_set**()) argument is NULL.

pte_eos
:   The *offset* argument is too big and the resulting position would be outside
    of *encoder*'s trace buffer (**pt_enc_sync_set**() only).
