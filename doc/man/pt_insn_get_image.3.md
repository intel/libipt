# NAME

pt_insn_get_image, pt_insn_set_image, pt_blk_get_image, pt_blk_set_image -
get/set an Intel(R) Processor Trace instruction flow or block decoder's traced
memory image descriptor


# SYNOPSIS

| **\#include `<intel-pt.h>`**
|
| **struct pt_image \*pt_insn_get_image(struct pt_insn_decoder \**decoder*);**
| **struct pt_image \*pt_blk_get_image(struct pt_block_decoder \**decoder*);**
|
| **int pt_insn_set_image(struct pt_insn_decoder \**decoder*,**
|                       **struct pt_image \**image*);**
| **int pt_blk_set_image(struct pt_block_decoder \**decoder*,**
|                      **struct pt_image \**image*);**

# DESCRIPTION

**pt_insn_get_image**() and **pt_blk_get_image**() return the traced memory
*image descriptor that decoder* uses for reading instruction memory.  See
***pt_image_alloc**(3).  Every decoder comes with a default *pt_image* object
*that is initially empty and that will automatically be destroyed when the
*decoder is freed.

**pt_insn_set_image**() and **pt_blk_set_image**() set the traced memory image
descriptor that *decoder* uses for reading instruction memory.  If the *image*
argument is NULL, sets *decoder*'s image to be its default image.  The user is
responsible for freeing the *pt_image* object that *image* points to when it is
no longer needed.


# RETURN VALUE

**pt_insn_get_image**() and **pt_blk_get_image**() return a pointer to
*decoder*'s *pt_image* object.  The returned pointer is NULL if the *decoder*
argument is NULL.

**pt_insn_set_image**() and **pt_blk_set_image**() return zero on success or a
negative *pt_error_code* enumeration constant in case of an error.


# ERRORS

pte_invalid
:   The *decoder* argument is NULL.


# NOTES

One *pt_image* object must not be shared between multiple decoders.  Use
**pt_image_copy**(3) to copy a common image.
