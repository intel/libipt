# NAME

pt_image_remove_by_filename, pt_image_remove_by_asid - remove sections from a
traced memory image descriptor


# SYNOPSIS

| **\#include `<intel-pt.h>`**
|
| **int pt_image_remove_by_filename(struct pt_image \**image*,**
|                                 **const char \**filename*,**
|                                 **const struct pt_asid \**asid*);**
| **int pt_image_remove_by_asid(struct pt_image \**image*,**
|                             **const struct pt_asid \**asid*);**

# DESCRIPTION

**pt_image_remove_by_filename**() removes all sections from *image* that were
added by a call to **pt_image_add_file**(3) with an identical *filename*
argument or by a call to **pt_image_copy**(3) from such a section.  Sections
that are based on the same underlying file but that were added using a different
*filename* argument are not removed.

If the *asid* argument is not NULL, it removes only sections that were added
with a matching address-space identifier.  See **pt_image_add_file**(3).

**pt_image_remove_by_asid**(3) removes all sections from *image* that were added
by a call to **pt_image_add_file**(3) with a matching *asid* argument or by a
call to **pt_image_copy**(3) from such a section.  See **pt_image_add_file**(3).

Two *pt_asid* objects match in their "cr3* or *vmcs* field if one of them does
not provide the field (i.e. sets it to *pt_asid_no_cr3* or *pt_asid_no_vmcs*
respectively) or if the provided values are identical.  Two *pt_asid* objects
match if they match in all fields.


# RETURN VALUE

Both functions return the number of sections removed on success or a negative
*pt_error_code* enumeration constant in case of an error.


# ERRORS

pte_invalid
:   The *image* argument is NULL or the *filename* argument is NULL
    (**pt_image_remove_by_filename**() only).


# EXAMPLE

~~~{.c}
int foo(struct pt_image *image, uint64_t cr3) {
	struct pt_asid asid1, asid2;
	int errcode;

	pt_asid_init(&asid1);
	asid1.cr3 = cr3;

	pt_asid_init(&asid2);
	asid2.cr3 = ~cr3;

	errcode = pt_image_add_file(image, "/path/to/libfoo.so",
								0xa000, 0x100, &asid1, 0xb000);
	if (errcode < 0)
		return errcode;

	errcode = pt_image_add_file(image, "rel/path/to/libfoo.so",
								0xa000, 0x100, &asid1, 0xc000);
	if (errcode < 0)
		return errcode;

	/* This call would only remove the section added first:
	 *
	 * - filename matches only the first section's filename
	 * - NULL matches every asid
	 */
	(void) pt_image_remove_by_filename(image,
									   "/path/to/libfoo.so",
									   NULL);

	/* This call would not remove any of the above sections:
	 *
	 * - filename matches the first section's filename
	 * - asid2 does not match asid1
	 */
	(void) pt_image_remove_by_filename(image,
									   "/path/to/libfoo.so",
									   &asid2);

	/* This call would not remove any of the above sections:
	 *
	 * - asid2 does not match asid1
	 */
	(void) pt_image_remove_by_asid(image, &asid2);

	/* This call would remove both sections:
	 *
	 * - asid1 matches itself
	 */
	(void) pt_image_remove_by_asid(image, &asid1);

	/* This call would remove both sections:
	 *
	 * - NULL matches every asid
	 */
	(void) pt_image_remove_by_asid(image, NULL);
