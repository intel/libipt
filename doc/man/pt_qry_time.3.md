# DESCRIPTION

**pt_qry_time**(), **pt_insn_time**(), and **pt_blk_time**() provide the current
estimated timestamp count (TSC) value in the unsigned integer variable pointed
to by the *time* argument.  The returned value corresponds to what an **rdtsc**
instruction would have returned.

At configurable intervals, Intel PT contains the full, accurate TSC value.
Between those intervals, the timestamp count is estimated using a collection of
lower-bandwidth packets, the Mini Time Counter (MTC) packet and the Cycle Count
Packet (CYC).  Depending on the Intel PT configuration, timing can be very
precise at the cost of increased bandwidth or less precise but requiring lower
bandwidth.

The decoder needs to be calibrated in order to translate Cycle Counter ticks
into Core Crystal Clock ticks.  Without calibration, CYC packets need to be
dropped.  The decoder calibrates itself using MTC, CYC, and CBR packets.

To interpret MTC and CYC packets, the decoder needs additional information
provided in respective fields in the *pt_config* structure.  Lacking this
information, MTC packets may need to be dropped.  This will impact the precision
of the estimated timestamp count by losing periodic updates and it will impact
calibration, which may result in reduced precision for cycle-accurate timing.

The number of dropped MTC and CYC packets gives a rough idea about the quality
of the estimated timestamp count.  The value of dropped MTC and CYC packets is
given in the unsigned integer variables pointed to by the *lost_mtc* and
*lost_cyc* arguments respectively.  If one or both of the arguments is NULL, no
information on lost packets is provided for the respective packet type.

**pt_qry_core_bus_ratio**(), **pt_insn_core_bus_ratio**(), and
**pt_blk_core_bus_ratio**() give the last known core:bus ratio as provided by
the Core Bus Ratio (CBR) Intel PT packet.


# RETURN VALUE

All functions return zero on success or a negative *pt_error_code* enumeration
constant in case of an error.


# ERRORS

pte_invalid
:   The *decoder* or *time* (**pt_qry_time**(), **pt_insn_time**(), and
    **pt_blk_time**()) or *cbr* (**pt_qry_core_bus_ratio**(),
    **pt_insn_core_bus_ratio**(), and **pt_blk_core_bus_ratio**()) argument is
    NULL.

pte_no_time
:   There has not been a TSC packet to provide the full, accurate Time Stamp
    Count.  There may have been MTC or CYC packets, so the provided *time* may
    be non-zero.  It is zero if there has not been any timing packet yet.

    Depending on the Intel PT configuration, TSC packets may not have been
    enabled.  In this case, the *time* value provides the relative time based on
    other timing packets.

pte_no_cbr
:   There has not been a CBR packet to provide the core:bus ratio.  The *cbr*
    value is undefined in this case.
