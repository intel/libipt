# NAME

pt_pkt_get_offset, pt_pkt_get_sync_offset - get an Intel(R) Processor Trace
packet decoder's current/synchronization trace buffer offset


# SYNOPSIS

| **\#include `<intel-pt.h>`**
|
| **int pt_pkt_get_offset(const struct pt_packet_decoder \**decoder*,**
|                       **uint64_t \**offset*);**
| **int pt_pkt_get_sync_offset(const struct pt_packet_decoder \**decoder*,**
|                            **uint64_t \**offset*);**

Link with *-lipt*.


# DESCRIPTION

**pt_pkt_get_offset**() provides *decoder*'s current position as offset in bytes
from the beginning of *decoder*'s trace buffer in the unsigned integer variable
pointed to by *offset*.

**pt_pkt_get_sync_offset**() provides *decoder*'s last synchronization point as
offset in bytes from the beginning of *decoder*'s trace buffer in the unsigned
integer variable pointed to by *offset*.


# RETURN VALUE

Both functions return zero on success or a negative *pt_error_code* enumeration
constant in case of an error.


# ERRORS

pte_invalid
:   The *decoder* or *offset* argument is NULL.

pte_nosync
:   *decoder* has not been synchronized onto the trace stream.  Use
    **pt_pkt_sync_forward**(3), **pt_pkt_sync_backward**(3), or
    **pt_pkt_sync_set**(3) to synchronize *decoder*.
