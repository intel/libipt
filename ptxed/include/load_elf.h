/* Load an ELF file.
 *
 * Adds sections for all ELF LOAD segments.
 *
 * The sections are loaded relative to their virtual addresses specified
 * in the ELF program header with the lowest address section loaded at @base.
 *
 * The name of the program in @prog is used for error reporting.
 * If @verbose is non-zero, prints information about loaded sections.
 *
 * Does not load dependent files.
 * Does not support dynamic relocations.
 *
 * Successfully loaded segments are not unloaded in case of errors.
 *
 * If @iscache is not NULL, use it to cache image sections.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success, a negative error code otherwise.
 * Returns -pte_invalid if @image or @file are NULL.
 * Returns -pte_bad_config if @file can't be processed.
 * Returns -pte_nomem if not enough memory can be allocated.
