Intel(R) Processor Trace Decoder Library
========================================

The Intel Processor Trace (Intel PT) Decoder Library is Intel's reference
implementation for decoding Intel PT.  It can be used as a standalone library or
it can be partially or fully integrated into your tool.

The library comes with a set of sample tools built on top of it and a test
system built on top of the sample tools.  The samples demonstrate how to use the
library and may serve as a starting point for integrating the library into your
tool.

support of upcoming (non-public) processors (NDA required).

Dependencies
------------

We use cmake for building.

  cmake         The cross-platform open-source build system.
                http://www.cmake.org


Other packages you need for some of the above optional components.

  xed           The Intel x86 instruction encoder and decoder.
                http://www.pintool.org - version 2.14-71313

                This is needed to build and run the trace disassembler example.

  yasm          The Yasm Modular Assembler
                http://github.com/yasm

                This is needed to run pttc.
